Welcome to the outline-mcp docs.

This documentation is written for users who want to run Outline through MCP in real environments, not just demos.

## What you can do here

- Connect your MCP client in minutes
- Apply safe permission boundaries (`read`, `write`, `delete`)
- Run document and collection workflows with confidence
- Operate multi-agent updates with conflict/lease controls
- Validate behavior before rollout with E2E scenarios
