Welcome to the official documentation for `outline-mcp`.

This guide is designed for real usage in real teams. Instead of short demo snippets, each page explains why a configuration exists, when you should use it, and how to avoid common mistakes during rollout.

## What is Outline?

[Outline](https://www.getoutline.com) is a collaborative documentation and knowledge base platform.
Teams use it to create internal docs, handbooks, runbooks, product specifications, and shared operating procedures.

`outline-mcp` is the MCP bridge that exposes those Outline capabilities to MCP clients and agents with explicit permission boundaries.

## What this project helps you do

With `outline-mcp`, you can connect Outline to MCP clients and let agents perform practical work with controlled permissions.

You can use it to:

- Read and search documents safely in read-only mode.
- Create, update, move, archive, restore, and batch-manage documents.
- Work with templates, comments, memberships, exports, and audit data.
- Coordinate concurrent agents with revision checks and lease-based ownership.
- Expose resource URIs so models can read collection and document context directly.

## What is covered in this documentation

This documentation includes:

- Installation and MCP client setup.
- Runtime configuration and permission design.
- Tool categories and practical usage patterns.
- Multi-agent operation strategies.
- Local and CI validation with inspector-based E2E testing.
- Troubleshooting for the most common operational failures.
