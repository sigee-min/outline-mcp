## Why permission modeling matters

Most production incidents are not caused by missing features. They are caused by excessive privileges in the wrong place.

`outline-mcp` gives you explicit action controls so each client can receive only the capabilities it needs.

## Action model

| Action | Scope | Typical tools |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | Non-mutating operations | `list_collections`, `search_documents`, `read_document`, `list_events` |
| `write` | Mutating but non-destructive operations | `create_document`, `update_document`, `move_document`, comments, memberships, leases |
| `delete` | Destructive operations | `delete_document`, `delete_comment`, `delete_collection`, batch delete |
| `admin` | Reserved advanced control | Rarely needed in standard flows |

## Recommended role mapping

| Role | Actions | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Reader agent | `read` | Safe default with zero mutation risk |
| Writer agent | `read,write` | Supports creation/editing without destructive paths |
| Operator agent | `read,write,delete` | Owns cleanup and lifecycle execution |

## Rollout governance

Use a progressive model:

1. Start every new client at `read`.
2. Promote to `read,write` only after successful validation.
3. Grant `delete` only to explicit operator paths.
4. Review action sets during each incident retrospective.

## Example profiles

### Read-only

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read
```

### Read and write

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write
```

### Full operator

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write,delete
```
