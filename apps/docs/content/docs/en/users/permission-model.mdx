## Action levels

- `read`: list/search/read/audit
- `write`: create/update/move/comment/membership/lease
- `delete`: delete document/comment/collection
- `admin`: reserved for advanced operational controls

## Recommended profiles

### Reader agent

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read
```

### Writer agent (no destructive actions)

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write
```

### Operator agent

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write,delete
```

## Safety rule

Treat `delete` as a separate approval boundary, not a default.
