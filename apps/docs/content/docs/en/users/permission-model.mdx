title: Permission Model
description: Design agent permissions with clear operational boundaries.
---

## Actions and intent

| Action | Typical usage | Should be default? |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | search, list, read, audit | Yes |
| `write` | create/update/move/comment/membership/lease | Usually yes after validation |
| `delete` | delete documents/comments/collections | No, explicit approval boundary |
| `admin` | advanced operational controls | Rare |

## Suggested role mapping

| Role | Recommended actions | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Reader agent | `read` | No mutation risk |
| Writer agent | `read,write` | Safe authoring without destructive actions |
| Operator agent | `read,write,delete` | Lifecycle and cleanup ownership |

## Implementation policy

- Start all new agents with `read`
- Promote to `read,write` after successful test cycle
- Grant `delete` only to trusted operator paths
- Keep permission profile explicit in each client config

## Example configs

### Reader

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read
```

### Writer

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write
```

### Operator

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read,write,delete
```
