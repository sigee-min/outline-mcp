## Symptom → likely cause → fix

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | action not enabled | adjust `OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS` and restart process |
| 401/403 from Outline | token/endpoint mismatch or restricted API | verify `OUTLINE_API_KEY`, `OUTLINE_BASE_URL`, workspace token scope |
| `CONFLICT_DETECTED` on safe update | document changed after your read | re-read document, merge changes, retry with latest revision |
| Lease conflict | another agent owns active lease | wait/retry or reassign through coordinator flow |
| Search results stale/missing | generated search artifacts out of date | rebuild docs and restart docs server |

## Quick diagnostics

### Check runtime config from MCP

Call:

- `server_info`

Verify:

- base URL
- allowed actions
- lease strategy
- capability probe state

### Validate read path first

- `list_collections`
- `read_document`

If read path fails, fix auth/endpoint before testing writes.

### Validate write path safely

- create temporary collection
- run `create_document` + `safe_update_document`
- clean up with `delete_document` / `delete_collection`
