## Baseline configuration

Use this as your default MCP server entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outline": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sigee-min/outline-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLINE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "OUTLINE_BASE_URL": "https://app.getoutline.com",
        "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read,write,delete"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Safer rollout profiles

Start with one of these profiles depending on your risk tolerance.

### Read-only profile

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read"
}
```

### Read and write profile (no delete)

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read,write"
}
```

### Self-hosted Outline profile

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_BASE_URL": "https://outline.your-company.internal"
}
```

## Recommended validation sequence

After adding client config, validate in this order:

1. `list_collections`
2. `search_documents`
3. `read_document`
4. `create_document` and `update_document` (only after write is enabled)
5. lifecycle and batch tools (only after policy approval)

This sequence gives you quick signal on auth, reachability, and permission boundaries.
