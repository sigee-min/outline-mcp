## Baseline config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "outline": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@sigeemin/outline-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OUTLINE_API_KEY": "your_api_key",
        "OUTLINE_BASE_URL": "https://app.getoutline.com",
        "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read,write,delete"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment variants

### Read-only

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read"
}
```

### Read/write (no delete)

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS": "read,write"
}
```

### Self-hosted Outline

```json
{
  "OUTLINE_BASE_URL": "https://outline.your-company.internal"
}
```

## Recommended rollout sequence

1. Start with `read`
2. Verify tool discovery and read paths
3. Move to `read,write`
4. Add `delete` only after your team approves deletion policy
