## Pattern A: revision-safe updates

1. `read_document`
2. capture current `revision`
3. call `safe_update_document` with `expected_revision`
4. on conflict, re-read and retry intentionally

## Pattern B: lease ownership

Use lease tools when many agents may target the same document in parallel.

- `acquire_document_lease`
- `renew_document_lease`
- `release_document_lease`

Use `data_attribute` strategy for cross-process coordination.

## Pattern C: workflow split

- Coordinator: collection/template orchestration
- Worker: document-level write operations
- Auditor: events/revisions/export checks

This role split reduces accidental privilege expansion.
