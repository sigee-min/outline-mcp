description: What outline-mcp is and how to adopt it safely.

## What it does

outline-mcp exposes Outline APIs as MCP tools, so agents can work with collections and documents through explicit contracts.

## Core goals

- Keep runtime permissions explicit
- Support Outline Cloud and self-hosted equally
- Reduce conflicts in multi-agent editing
- Provide testable operational workflows

## Before you begin

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+
- Outline API key
- A target MCP client (Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## First milestone

Get one client connected with read-only access:

```bash
OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS=read
```

Then expand to `read,write` or `read,write,delete` only after validation.
