## What is Outline?

[Outline](https://www.getoutline.com) is a team knowledge base platform.
It provides structured spaces for documents, collections, permissions, comments, memberships, and publishing workflows.

## What outline-mcp is

`outline-mcp` is an MCP server that maps Outline API capabilities into structured MCP tools and resources.

In practice, this means your MCP client can call well-defined operations such as reading documents, updating content, managing memberships, exporting collections, or coordinating concurrent edits.

## How a typical request flows

A normal request path is:

1. The MCP client calls a tool.
2. `outline-mcp` validates input and checks allowed actions.
3. The server calls the appropriate Outline endpoint.
4. The response is normalized and returned to the client.

Because permissions are enforced server-side, you can safely run different clients with different capabilities.

## Core safety model

The default safety model combines three controls:

- Explicit action gating through `OUTLINE_ALLOWED_ACTIONS`.
- Conflict-aware document updates through `safe_update_document`.
- Lease-based ownership for concurrent workers on hot documents.

If you apply these three controls from day one, most accidental mutation issues are prevented before they become incidents.

## Recommended first rollout

Use this rollout order:

1. Start with `read` only.
2. Validate `list_collections`, `search_documents`, and `read_document`.
3. Move to `read,write` for controlled creation/update paths.
4. Add `delete` only when document lifecycle ownership is clear.

## Minimum requirements

You need:

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- An Outline API key.
- An MCP client (Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or equivalent).
