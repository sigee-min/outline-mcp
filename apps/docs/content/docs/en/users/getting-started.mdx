## Who this page is for

- You are new to outline-mcp
- You need a safe first rollout plan
- You want practical defaults, not theory

## What outline-mcp gives you

outline-mcp exposes Outline operations as MCP tools with explicit action controls.

You can use it for:

- Collection and document workflows
- Template-based document generation
- Membership and collaboration flows
- Export pipelines and audit visibility

## Safe first rollout

1. Connect one MCP client with read-only policy
2. Confirm basic reads work (`list_collections`, `read_document`)
3. Expand to `read,write`
4. Enable `delete` only when your lifecycle policy is clear

## Minimum requirements

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10+ (for monorepo usage)
- Outline API key
- One MCP client (Codex, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Next step

Go to [Installation](/en/docs/users/installation).
