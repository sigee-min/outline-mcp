This section is your practical runbook for operating `outline-mcp`.

Each page is written so a team can move from first setup to controlled production use without guessing hidden behavior.

## How to use this section

Use this section in phases.

### Phase 1: Connect and validate

- [Getting Started](/en/docs/users/getting-started)
- [Installation](/en/docs/users/installation)
- [MCP Client Setup](/en/docs/users/mcp-client-setup)

### Phase 2: Define safety boundaries

- [Configuration](/en/docs/users/configuration)
- [Permission Model](/en/docs/users/permission-model)

### Phase 3: Operate at scale

- [Tool Reference](/en/docs/users/tool-reference)
- [Multi-Agent Operations](/en/docs/users/multi-agent-operations)
- [Testing and E2E](/en/docs/users/testing-and-e2e)
- [Troubleshooting](/en/docs/users/troubleshooting)

## First-week rollout plan

A practical first-week plan usually looks like this:

1. Start one client in `read` mode and validate discovery/read paths.
2. Enable `read,write` for a controlled workspace and validate update patterns.
3. Introduce safe update and lease patterns for concurrent agents.
4. Enable delete paths only after your lifecycle policy is approved.
5. Add CI validation with optional E2E for regression protection.

Following this sequence reduces risk while still moving quickly.
